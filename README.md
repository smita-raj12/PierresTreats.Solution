# Pierre's Sweet and Savory Treats

Pierre wants to create a new application to market his sweet and savory treats. 
So this web application is use to built with user authentication and a many-to-many relationship. Here are the some features of the application:

* The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality. All users should be able to have read functionality.

* There should be a many-to-many relationship between Treats and Flavors. A treat can have many flavors (such as sweet, savory, spicy, or creamy) and a flavor can have many treats. For instance, the "sweet" flavor could include chocolate croissants, cheesecake, and so on.

* A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all treats and flavors. Users should be able to click on an individual treat or flavor to see all the treats/flavors that belong to it.

* This application has separate roles for admins and logged-in users. Only admins should be able to add, update and delete. There is an order form that only logged-in users can access. A logged-in user should be able to create, read, update and delete their own order.
